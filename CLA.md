# Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in contributing to LinkForty Core.

In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with contributions from any person or entity, LinkForty must have a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) on file that has been signed by each contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below.

This agreement is for your protection as a contributor as well as the protection of LinkForty and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own contributions for any other purpose.

## Agreement

By submitting a pull request to this repository, you agree to the following terms:

1. **Grant of License.** You grant LinkForty a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, sublicense, and otherwise exploit your contributions on any terms, including in proprietary software.

2. **Right to Grant.** You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above license. If your employer has rights to intellectual property that you create, you represent that you have received permission to make the contributions on behalf of that employer, or that your employer has waived such rights for your contributions.

3. **Original Work.** You represent that each of your contributions is your original creation. You represent that your contributions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction of which you are aware and which is associated with any part of your contributions.

4. **No Warranty.** You provide your contributions on an "as is" basis, without warranty of any kind.

5. **Ongoing Rights.** You retain all right, title, and interest in your contributions. You are free to use your contributions for any other purpose.

## Why We Need This

LinkForty Core is licensed under the AGPL-3.0, and we also offer LinkForty Cloud as a commercial product built on top of Core. This CLA ensures we can continue to maintain both the open-source project and the commercial offering, while you retain full ownership of your contributions.

## How to Sign

When you open your first pull request, the CLA Assistant bot will post a comment with a link to sign. You'll authorize via GitHub OAuth and your signature is recorded. This is a one-time process — once signed, all future contributions are covered.
